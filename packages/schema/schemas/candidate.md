Candidate for a calculator

Candidate is the subject which is used to calculate the match with the user's answers. It can be a person or an orgianization (e.g. party), but also any other entity (e.g. candidate list).

Candidate can contain references to persons or organizations, which are then used to present the candidate to the user.

It is also possible to nest the candidates into each other, which allows to present groupped candidates results. For example the top level candidate, e.g. party, can contain other candidates, e.g. members of a parliament. In case the answers are provided just for the nested candidates, the top level candidate answer is calculated as the average answer of the nested candidates. In case separate answers for the top level candidate are provided, top level and nested candidates result is independent.
